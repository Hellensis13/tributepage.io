                    The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent 
                    school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The guitarist and singer Thom Yorke 
                    and the bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O'Brien 
                    and the drummer Philip Selway the year above. Colin's brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, 
                    was two years below Yorke and Colin, and the last to join. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, 
                    the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. 
                    The band disliked the school's strict atmosphere—the headmaster once charged them 
                    for using a rehearsal room on a Sunday—and found solace in the music department. 
                    They credited their music teacher for introducing them to jazz, film scores, postwar avant-garde music, 
                    and 20th-century classical music.

                    While each member contributed songs in the band's early period, Yorke emerged as the main songwriter.
                    According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, 
                    rather than through any particular interest: "It was more of a collective angle, and if you could 
                    contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool."
                    At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section. Oxfordshire and the Thames Valley had an active 
                    independent music scene in the late 1980s, but it centred on shoegazing bands such as Ride and Slowdive.
                    On a Friday played their first gig in 1987, at Oxford's Jericho Tavern.

                    On the strength of an early demo, On a Friday were offered a record deal by Island Records, 
                    but they decided they were not ready and wanted to go to university first. In 1987, all but Jonny 
                    had left Abingdon to attend university. On a Friday continued to rehearse on weekends and holidays,
                    but did not perform for four years. At the University of Exeter, Yorke played with the band Headless Chickens, 
                    performing songs including future Radiohead material. He also met Stanley Donwood, who later became Radiohead's 
                    cover artist.

                    In 1991, the band members regrouped in Oxford, sharing a house on the corner of Magdalen Road and Ridgefield Road.
                    They recorded another demo, which attracted the attention of Chris Hufford, Slowdive's producer and the co-owner 
                    of Oxford's Courtyard Studios. Hufford and his business partner, Bryce Edge, attended a concert at the 
                    Jericho Tavern; impressed, they became On a Friday's managers. According to Hufford, at this point the band had 
                    "all of the elements of Radiohead", but with a rougher, punkier sound and faster tempos. At Courtyard Studios, 
                    On a Friday recorded the Manic Hedgehog demo tape, named after an Oxford record shop.

                    In late 1991, Colin happened to meet the EMI A&R representative Keith Wozencroft at a record shop and 
                    handed him a copy of the demo. Wozencroft was impressed and attended a performance. 
                    That November, On a Friday performed at the Jericho Tavern to an audience that included 
                    several A&R representatives. It was only their eighth gig, but they had attracted interest from 
                    several record companies. On 21 December, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI.
                    At EMI's request, they changed their name; "Radiohead" was taken from the song "Radio Head" on the 
                    Talking Heads album True Stories (1986). Yorke said the name "sums up all these things about receiving stuff ... 
                    It's about the way you take information in, the way you respond to the environment you're put in."
